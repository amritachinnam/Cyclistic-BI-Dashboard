# 🚴 Cyclistic Business Intelligence Dashboard  

### **Overview**  
This project is part of my **Google Business Intelligence Certification**, where I built a **dynamic Tableau dashboard** analyzing **Cyclistic bike-sharing data**. The goal was to help decision-makers understand **customer demand trends, station usage, and seasonal patterns**.  

📊 **Key Features:**  
- **Interactive Tableau Dashboard** – Users can **click on the map** to dynamically filter other visual elements, such as tables and trend charts.  There are also filters on the page which self define the actions on the dashboard.
- **Data Extraction using Google BigQuery** – Combined **three public datasets** to generate insights.  
- **Comprehensive BI Documentation** – Developed **Project Requirements, Stakeholder Requirements, and Strategy Documents** to align with business goals.  


## 🔍 **Project Steps**  

### **Step 1: Business Requirements & Documentation**  
Before diving into data, I created key **BI documents** to define the project scope and align with stakeholders.  
📂 Requirements Document - https://github.com/amritachinnam/Cyclistic-BI-Dashboard/tree/main/Requirements%20Document 


### **Step 2: Data Extraction & Preparation**  
I used **Google BigQuery** to retrieve data from **three public datasets** and merged them into an **Excel file** for Tableau visualization.  


## **Public Datasets Used:**  
- 🚲 **new_york_citibike** – BigQuery public dataset for ride details  
- 📍 **geo_us_boundaries** – Used for mapping station locations  
- 🌦️ **GSOD (Global Surface Summary of the Day)** – Integrated **weather conditions** to analyze their impact on bike demand  


### **Step 3: Tableau Dashboard Development**  
**Final output:** https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/amrita.chinnam/viz/CyclisticGoogleBusinessIntelligenceDashboard/SummerTrends

📊 **Dashboard Features:**  
- **Trip Analysis**: A **table and map visualization** showing bike usage across different stations  
- **Peak Usage Trends**: Identifies **popular stations based on trip minutes**  
- **Seasonality Trends**: Compares **bike usage across different months**  
- **User Type Segmentation**: Analysis of **subscribers vs. casual riders**  
- **Dashboard Actions**: Clickable maps **filter other charts dynamically**  

📝 **Dashboard Insights:**  
1. 🚴 Most trips originate from **Bushwick & Williamsburg, Central Brooklyn, and Chelsea & Clinton**  
2. 🕒 Peak usage occurs in **summer months** with significant drop-offs during winter  
3. ☔ **Weather impacts bike usage**, with a **sharp decline on rainy and snowy days**
