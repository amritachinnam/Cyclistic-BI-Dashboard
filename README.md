# 🚴 Cyclistic Business Intelligence Dashboard  

## **Overview**  
This project is part of my **Google Business Intelligence Certification**, where I built a **dynamic Tableau dashboard** analyzing **Cyclistic bike-sharing data**. The goal was to help decision-makers understand **customer demand trends, station usage, and seasonal patterns**.  

📊 **Key Features:**  
- **Interactive Tableau Dashboard** – Users can **click on the map** to dynamically filter other visual elements, such as tables and trend charts.  There are also filters on the page which self define the actions on the dashboard.
- **Data Extraction using Google BigQuery** – Combined **three public datasets** to generate insights.  
- **Comprehensive BI Documentation** – Developed **Project Requirements, Stakeholder Requirements, and Strategy Documents** to align with business goals.  


## 🔍 **Project Steps**  

### **Step 1: Business Requirements & Documentation**  
Before diving into data, I created key **BI documents** to define the project scope and align with stakeholders.  
📂 Requirements Document - https://github.com/amritachinnam/Cyclistic-BI-Dashboard/tree/main/Requirements%20Document 


### **Step 2: Data Extraction & Preparation**  
I used **Google BigQuery** to retrieve data from **three public datasets** and merged them into an **Excel file** for Tableau visualization.  


 **Public Datasets Used:**  
- 🚲 **new_york_citibike** – BigQuery public dataset for ride details  
- 📍 **geo_us_boundaries** – Used for mapping station locations  
- 🌦️ **GSOD (Global Surface Summary of the Day)** – Integrated **weather conditions** to analyze their impact on bike demand  


### **Step 3: Tableau Dashboard Development**

📊 **Dashboard Features:**  


1. **Navigation & Views**:  
   - Clicking on **Summer Trends** displays summer trends analysis.  
   - Clicking on **Seasonality** presents seasonal trends but **does not** have interactive action features.  
   - Clicking on **Top Trips** reveals trips categorized by **starting and ending locations**.  

2. **Interactive Clickable Filters**:  
   - Users can filter data dynamically based on:  
     ✅ **User Type** (Subscriber vs. Casual)  
     ✅ **Starting & Ending Locations**  
     ✅ **Month Selection**  
     ✅ **Metric Selector**  

3. **Advanced Interactive Features**:  
   - Clicking on the **main map** updates the **trends of the month** and **trends of the station**.  
   - Hovering over **Trend by Month** dynamically updates **Trends of Station**.  
   - Hovering over **Trends of Station** also updates **Trend by Month** for better insights.  

4. **Non-Interactive Views**:  
   - **Seasonality** and **Top Trips** views are purely analytical with **no action features**.  


📝 **Dashboard Insights:**  
### **Updated README.md - Dashboard Insights Section**  

## 📊 **Dashboard Insights**  

- **How are customers using bikes?**  
  - **Subscribers take frequent, shorter trips (39 min avg) for commuting, while casual riders take longer rides (42 min avg), mainly for leisure.**  

- **What is the customer demand at different station locations?**  
  - **Chelsea & Clinton, Lower East Side, and Upper East Side see the highest and most consistent ridership across seasons, indicating strong year-round demand.**  

- **How can we get customer usage insights to inform new station growth?**  
  - **Expansion should focus on high-traffic locations like Chelsea & Clinton and Upper East Side, where demand is high but supply is limited.**  

- **How were bikes used by our customers?**  
  - **Subscribers use bikes mostly for weekday commutes, while casual users ride on weekends in tourist-heavy areas like parks and shopping districts.**  

- **How can we apply insights from the data generated by trip data?**  
  - **Redistribution strategies, subscription incentives, and weather-based pricing adjustments can optimize bike availability and user engagement.**  

- **Which months show the highest trends?**  
  - **The highest trip counts occur in April, August, and December, with February showing the lowest ridership due to winter conditions.**
