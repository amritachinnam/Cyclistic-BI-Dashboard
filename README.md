# **🚴 Cyclistic Business Intelligence Dashboard**  

## **Overview**  
This project is part of my **[Google Business Intelligence Certification](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-business-intelligence)**, where I built a **dynamic Tableau dashboard** analyzing **Cyclistic bike-sharing data**. The goal was to help decision-makers understand **customer demand trends, station usage, and seasonal patterns**.


## **📊 Key Features**  

- **Interactive Tableau Dashboard** – Users can **click on the map** to dynamically filter other visual elements, such as tables and trend charts. **Filters** on the page define the actions available within the dashboard.  
- **Data Extraction using Google BigQuery** – Integrated **three public datasets** to generate actionable insights.  
- **Comprehensive BI Documentation** – Developed **Project Requirements, Stakeholder Requirements, and Strategy Documents** to align with business goals.  


## **🔍 Project Steps**  

### **Step 1: Business Requirements & Documentation**  
📂 **[Requirements Document](https://github.com/amritachinnam/Cyclistic-BI-Dashboard/tree/main/Requirements%20Document)** – Defined project scope, stakeholder needs, and success criteria.  

### **Step 2: Data Extraction & Preparation**  
Utilized **Google BigQuery** to retrieve and process datasets, merging them into an **Excel file** for Tableau visualization.  

📌 **Public Datasets Used:**  
- **new_york_citibike** – Trip details dataset.  
- **geo_us_boundaries** – Used for mapping station locations.  
- **GSOD (Global Surface Summary of the Day)** – Integrated **weather conditions** to analyze their impact on bike demand.  

### **Step 3: Tableau Dashboard Development**  
📊 **[Live Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/amrita.chinnam/viz/CyclisticGoogleBusinessIntelligenceDashboard/SummerTrends)**  

## **📊 Dashboard Features**  

### **Navigation & Views**  
- **Summer Trends** – Displays **summer ridership patterns**.  
- **Seasonality** – Analyzes **monthly variations** (*No interactive actions*).  
- **Top Trips** – Shows **popular starting and ending trip locations**.  

### **Interactive Features**  
- **Filters** – Users can filter data by **User Type, Start & End Locations, Month, and Metric Selector**.  
- **Click Actions** – Clicking on the **main map updates Trends of the Month and Trends of the Station**.  
- **Hover Actions** – Hovering over **Trend by Month updates Trends of Station, and vice versa**.  

## **📊 Dashboard Insights**  

- **Customer Usage** – **Subscribers (39 min avg)** ride frequently for commuting, while **casual riders (42 min avg)** take longer trips for leisure.  
- **High-Demand Locations** – **Chelsea & Clinton, Lower East Side, and Upper East Side** have the **highest and most consistent ridership** year-round.  
- **Station Growth Insights** – Expansion should **prioritize high-traffic areas** where **demand is high but stations are limited**.  
- **Weekday vs. Weekend Trends** – **Subscribers ride on weekdays** for commuting, while **casual riders use bikes on weekends** in tourist-heavy areas.  
- **Optimizing Bike Availability** – **Redistribution strategies, subscription incentives, and weather-based adjustments** can improve fleet efficiency.  
- **Seasonal Trends** – **April, August, and December** have **peak ridership**, while **February** sees the lowest usage due to winter conditions.
