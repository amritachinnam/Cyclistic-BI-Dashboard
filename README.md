# **Cyclistic Business Intelligence Dashboard**  

## **Overview**  
This project was developed as part of the **[Google Business Intelligence Certification](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-business-intelligence)** to analyze **Cyclistic bike-sharing data**. The goal was to provide **insights on customer demand, station usage, and seasonal trends** through a **dynamic Tableau dashboard** to support data-driven decision-making.

## **Key Features**  
- **Interactive Tableau Dashboard** â€“ Users can **click on the map** to dynamically filter **tables and trend charts**, with additional filter options.  
- **Data Extraction via Google BigQuery** â€“ Merged **three public datasets** for deeper analysis.  
- **Comprehensive BI Documentation** â€“ Created **Project Requirements, Stakeholder Requirements, and Strategy Documents** to align with business needs.  


## **Project Steps**  

### **1. Business Requirements & Documentation**  
ðŸ“„ **[Requirements Document](https://github.com/amritachinnam/Cyclistic-BI-Dashboard/tree/main/Requirements%20Document)** â€“ Defined the project scope, stakeholder needs, and success criteria.  

### **2. Data Extraction & Preparation**  
Utilized **Google BigQuery** to extract and process datasets, merging them into an **Excel file** for Tableau visualization.  

**Public Datasets Used:**  
- **new_york_citibike** â€“ Trip details dataset.  
- **geo_us_boundaries** â€“ Mapping station locations.  
- **GSOD (Global Surface Summary of the Day)** â€“ Integrated **weather conditions** to analyze impact on bike demand.  

### **3. Tableau Dashboard Development**  
ðŸ“Š **[Live Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/amrita.chinnam/viz/CyclisticGoogleBusinessIntelligenceDashboard/SummerTrends)**  


## **Dashboard Features**  

### **Navigation & Views**  
- **Summer Trends** â€“ Displays **seasonal ridership patterns**.  
- **Seasonality** â€“ Analyzes **monthly variations** (*No interactive actions*).  
- **Top Trips** â€“ Shows **popular starting and ending trip locations**.  

### **Interactive Features**  
- **Filters** â€“ Users can filter data by **User Type, Start & End Locations, Month, and Metric Selector**.  
- **Click Actions** â€“ Clicking on the main **map updates Trends of the Month and Trends of the Station**.  
- **Hover Actions** â€“ Hovering over **Trend by Month updates Trends of Station, and vice versa**.  

### **Static Views**  
- **Seasonality & Top Trips** â€“ Analytical insights only (*No interactivity*).  


## **Dashboard Insights**  

- **How are customers using bikes?**  
  - **Subscribers** take frequent, shorter trips (**39 min avg**) for **commuting**, while **casual riders** take longer rides (**42 min avg**) mainly for **leisure**.  

- **What is the customer demand at different station locations?**  
  - **Chelsea & Clinton, Lower East Side, and Upper East Side** have **high and consistent ridership**, making them **ideal locations for station expansion**.  

- **How can we use trip data to improve station growth?**  
  - Expansion should focus on **high-traffic areas where station supply is low**, especially **Chelsea & Clinton and Upper East Side**.  

- **What are the usage trends between subscribers and casual riders?**  
  - **Subscribers ride on weekdays for commutes**, while **casual riders use bikes on weekends in tourist-heavy areas**.  

- **How can insights from trip data optimize bike availability?**  
  - **Redistribution strategies**, **membership incentives**, and **weather-based pricing adjustments** can **improve bike availability and increase user engagement**.  

- **Which months have the highest ridership?**  
  - **April, August, and December** see **peak trip counts**, while **February has the lowest ridership due to winter conditions**.
